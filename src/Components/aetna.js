                  <h4>The Overview</h4>
                  <p>
                  I joined Aetna Digital's design team as a UX design intern as the team worked to add new
                   features to the Aetna Health application. It was an incredible opportunity — taking
                    the complexities of health insurance and creating a user-friendly application is no 
                    easy task. The design team referred to itself as team MISL: Make Insurance Suck Less.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  This case study focuses on the intern capstone project. I worked with five interns 
                  from various other fields; we had interns from development, business, and marketing
                   represented. We were tasked with designing a solution to some sort of health equity problem.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Understanding the Problem</h4>
                  <p>A team member had a family member die from colorectal cancer, so we decided to look 
                    into the problems affecting this cancer. To learn more, we began researching some 
                    statistics. (source)</p>

                    <div className="statistics">
                      <div>

                      </div>

                    <div className="info-detail">
                      <div>
                        <h4>Diagnosis & Mortality by Race</h4>
                        <p>Diving deeper into our research, we also found that colorectal cancer
                           disproponately affects men and women of color when compared with the non-hispanic 
                           white population. Incidence rates are 20% higher for black populations, and 
                           mortality rates are 40% higher for black communities.</p>
                           <p>
                           Research suggests these differences largely reflect differences in socioeconomic
                            status and education levels. This largely stems from the prevalence of risk
                             factors in these communities (smoking, obesity, etc.) and the lack of screenings.
                           </p>

                    <h4>We're not going to fix socioeconomic disparities with an app.</h4>
                    <p>Solving the root causes of socioeconomic disparities via a summer internship
                       and iOS application is unlikely. This presented a problem — if our goal is 
                       to find an equitable solution to a health disparity facing our nation, do 
                       we move forward with our research, or go back to the drawing board to find 
                       another problem. To be entirely honest, we were short for time at this point, 
                       so we chose to move forward and research why people from these communities are 
                       less likely to get colorectal cancer screenings. We learned the following.</p>

                       <p>This is a lot of data, and a very complex problem. 
                         To brainstorm solutions, we decided to use a good, 'ol-fashioned 
                         whiteboard so we could get ideas and thoughts out of our minds. 
                         Here's a picture of our brain map, cleaned up a little bit for readability:</p>

                             <p>We devised a plan that we think helps meet our goal 
                               while using Aetna's existing resources, therefore helping
                                Aetna as a whole. It consists of 2 parts.</p>
                           
                           
                           
                             <h4>(1) Increasing Testing Availability</h4>
                             <p>Our goal is to be equitable for those who would not normally
                                have access to testing. By utilizing resources such as 
                                take-home tests or Aetna'a Cora mobile clinic, we 
                                can increase testing while tackling the major problems 
                                of transportation and cost.</p>
                             

                           
                             <h4>(2) Spreading Awareness</h4>
                             <p>Many of the stigmas surrounding colorectal cancer screenings
                                stem from misinformation being passed by word of mouth. 
                                By utilizing the Aetna Health application and a targeted 
                                ad campaign, we can increase awareness for the types of 
                                screenings available while displaying the importance of 
                                being screened.</p>

                         <h4>Utilizing Aetna's design system to create a user flow</h4>
                         <p>I was tasked with creating a user flow to increase awareness through the 
                           Aetna Health application. Luckily, the design team had already solidified 
                           a user flow they called 'Next Best Action', or NBA.</p>
                           <p>
                           NBA flows are designed to inform users of actions they can take 
                           to improve their health. It generally starts with a notification
                            that opens a pop-up in the app. This pop-up shares general 
                            information with the option of viewing more, or completing a
                             designated action.

                                colorectal cancer screenings in the previous 7 years, or a 
                                relative who fits that criteria.

                           The pop-up has much more flexibility than the notification for actually 
                           designing a user interface. Based on the Aetna Health design standards, 
                           these pop-ups have a large image covering the top portion of the screen, 
                           followed by a few bullet points and a large call-to-action. I followed 
                           this design because it helps the team meet our goals - the large visual 
                           is appealing and makes it easy to display information in a quick, easily-readable way.

                           For either user flow, the article was out of my hands. 
                           The copy team is in charge of producing this information, 
                           so I simply designed the user interface for each of them. 
                           The information is expected to be short and succinct with
                            more resources available. I still wanted users to have a 
                            quick call-to-action, so the information and resources are 
                            split between two different containers.
